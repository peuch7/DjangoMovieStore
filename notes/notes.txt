Double curly braces: Variables, expressions, and template tags 
are enclosed within double curly braces. For example, {{ variable }}.

Template tags: Control structures and logic are defined within template 
tags, which are enclosed within {% %}. Template tags allow for loops, 
conditionals, and other control flow statements. 
For example, {% if condition %} ... {% endif %}.

Comments: Comments in DTL are enclosed within {# #} and are not 
rendered in the final output HTML.

Template inheritance: Django templates support inheritance, allowing 
for the creation of base templates that define the overall structure 
and layout of a page, with child templates inheriting and overriding 
specific blocks or sections.
